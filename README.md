# Healthcare SQL Project using Synthea Synthetic data 

## Overview / Description

This projects uses healthcare data generated by [Synthea](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea), which is a **Synthetic Patient Population Simulator**. Synthea is primarily use too output synthetic, realistic (but not real), patient data and associated health records in a variety of formats. 

The aim of this project is to demonstrate my capability in using SQL (**MySQL**) by writing queries answering common healthcare Key Performance Indicator (KPI), and business questions generated by ChatGPT. 

## SQL Skills Used 
1. Common Table Expression (CTEs)
2. Windows Function (LAG, RANK, RANK_PERCENT, ROW_NUMBER)
3. Subqueries 
4. JOIN (Left Join)
5. Aggregate Function (SUM, AVG, COUNT)

## Questions Answered 

COMMON KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATOR 
1. **Readmission Rate %** of patients readmitted within 30 days of discharge
2. **Mortality Rate %** of patients who die during treatment
3. **Average Length of Stay (ALOS)** / How long patients stay admitted on average
4. **Patient Turnaround Time** / Time between patient admission and discharge
5. **Cost per Patient**	/ Total care costs divided by number of patients

BUSINESS QUESTIONS
1. Which top 5 providers had the highest number of unique patients over time, and how did their monthly patient count trend?
2. What is the average claim amount per diagnosis code, segmented by gender?
3. Identify patients with more than 3 hospital encounters within the last year of data
